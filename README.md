# Rate-Monotonic-Scheduling
Python code for RMS 
In computer science, rate-monotonic scheduling (RMS) is a priority assignment algorithm used in real-time operating systems (RTOS) with a static-priority scheduling class. The static priorities are assigned according to the cycle duration of the job, so a shorter cycle duration results in a higher job priority.

A sample input:


| Task	  |Execution time | Period |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| Task 1  | 2  | 8|
| Task 1  | 1  | 6|
|Task 1   |  3| 12|            |
